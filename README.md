# BellyButtonBiodiversity

For this project, we were given data on bacteria found in the belly buttons of test subjects.

The object of this site is to make that data explorable based on the test subject ID.

Choose a test subject ID from the dropdown menu and the charts will update to show you what types and amounts of bacteria were found in bar chart and bubble chart form.

There's also a handy meter to show you how often that belly button was washed weekly. Some were 0! Is there a correlation between washing frequency and type or amount of bacteria? You decide.

You can view the website and explore the data here - <a href="https://songmanrob.github.io/BellyButtonBiodiversity/">https://songmanrob.github.io/BellyButtonBiodiversity/</a>
